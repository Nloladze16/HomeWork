# Assignment 3: Number Relationship Analyzer
### Difficulty: Beginner-Intermediate
Write a program that takes two numbers and determines their relationship using the `or` and `and` operators:

- First, tell the user if the numbers are equal or not equal
- If they're not equal, tell them which is larger
- Also determine if both numbers are positive, both negative, or mixed signs

## Requirements:

- Use `or` and `and` operators appropriately
- Practice efficient conditional logic
- Format output clearly
- Use float numbers

## Sample Output:
```
Enter first number: -5
Enter second number: 10
The numbers are not equal
10 is greater than -5
The numbers have mixed signs
```
